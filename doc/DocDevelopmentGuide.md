### Principles

- First native language, then translate.

### Requirements

- First paragraph of article should be the same as hidden description of it in content article ( README.md ).
- Order in both Ukrainian and English versions of files should be the same.
- Use code styling for code. Usually \`...\`. In some cases < code >...< /code >.

### Recommendations

- Use utility willbe, not package willbe.
- Minimize water, negation and strong statements.
- Don't mention name of referent explicitly.

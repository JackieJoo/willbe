### Principles

- First native language, then translate.

### Requirements

- First paragraph of article should be the same as hidden description of it in content article ( README.md ).
- Order in both Ukrainian and English versions of files should be the same.
- Use code styling for code. Usually \`...\`. In some cases < code >...< /code >.

### Recommendations

- Use characterizing word with noun instead of only noun.
<br>*Fore example, instead of:*<br>
Utility `willbe` instead of `willbe`.<br>
Section `build` instead of `build`.<br>
Resource `step` instead of `step`.<br>
Etc..
- Use utility `willbe`, not package `willbe`.
- Minimize water, negation and strong statements.
- Use implicit referencing. Don't mention name of referent explicitly.
<br>*Fore example, instead of:*<br>
In the pervious tutorial [ "Predefined steps" ](PredefinedSteps.md) predefined steps were used to compose a build.
<br>*Should be:*<br>
In the [ pervious tutorial ](PredefinedSteps.md) predefined steps were used to compose a build.
- Separate section for example is preferable.
- Detailed description of illustration/code should goes after illustration/code. Before illustration should be title of section or very short description if it's appropriate.

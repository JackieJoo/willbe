# Resources inheritance  

It is the approach to describing a module when <code>will-file</code> can reuse (inherit) field values of another resource(s) of the same type.

By inheritance, a resource is able to change and complement inherited resource. Resources inheritance allows reusing of the `will-file` resources which are built by a user and are generated by module export. It facilitates module construction.  

The diagram below shows the relation of the parent resource to the child resource.

### Inhetitance properties:

- child resource can change parent resource.
- child resource can complement parent resource.
- there are resources that take parameters like criterions, paths and so on;
- parameters are given in the child resource.

### Using the resources which belong to the same module

The following steps are required to use resource inheritance within single `will-file`:
- specify the parent resource;
- if needed, change or complement the field of resource.

### Using the resources which belong to the different module

The following steps are required to use resource inheritance from another `will-file`:
- connect external `will-file` as submodule in the section `submodule`;
- specify the path to the parent resource in `inherit` field. For example, `inherit : submodule::NameOfSubmodule/section::NameOfSection/NameOfResource`, which means that submodule, section and resource are specified clearly;
- if needed, specify criterions and complement the fields of the resource.

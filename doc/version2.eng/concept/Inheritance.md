# Resources inheritance  

It is the approach to describing a module when `will-file` can reuse (inherit) value of fields of another resource(s) of the same type.

By inheritance, a resource is able to change and complement inherited resource. Inheritance by resources allows reuse of the `will-file` resources which are built by a user and generated by export of a module. It facilitates module construction.  

The diagram below shows the relation of the resource which is followed (parent resource) with the resource which follows (child resource).

### Properties:

- following resource can change followed resource.
- following resource can complement followed resource.
- there are resources, which takes parameters like criterions, paths and so on;
- parameters are given in resource which follows.

### Using of the resources which belong the same module

For the use of inheritance by resources within the borders of one `will-file` the following steps are required:
- specify the resource which will be followed;
- if needed, change or complement the field of resource.

### Using of the resources which belong the different module

For the use of inheritance by resources from another `will-file` the following steps are required:
- connect external `will-file` as submodule in the section `submodule`;
- specify in field `inherit` the path to the resource, which will be followed. For example, `inherit : submodule::NameOfSubmodule/section::NameOfSection/NameOfResource`, which means that submodule, section and resource are specified clearly;
- if needed, specify criterions and complement the fields of the resource.

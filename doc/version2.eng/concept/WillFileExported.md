### Exported <code>will-file</code> (<code>out-will-file</code>)

<code>Out-will-file</code> is a kind of <code>will-file</code> which is generated by the utility during exporting of a module. Other modules can use the module by importing its <code>out-will-file</code>.

The `out-will-file` is generated from the original file by completely copying it and supplementing information such as:
- list of exported files;
- the current version of the module;
- format version;
- the location of the original `will-file`.

All this information is recorded in the [exported](SectionExported.md) section of the generated file.

Description of the exported `out-will-file`
- section-field `format` denotes the executable file format of the utility. It has the value `willfile-1.0.0`.
- the `about` section is copied from the original `will-file`. The field  `enabled : 1` is added.
- the `path` section copies the resources from the original file and additionally includes the resources generated by the utility:
  - `exportedDir.[build]` - paths to exported module directories;  
  - `exportedFiles.[build]`- list of exported files;
  - `archiveFile.[build]` -  path to the archive with exported files. This field is present if the export of archive has been enabled (`tar : 1`);
- in the section `reflector` the data of the source file and the generated resources are placed. Added fields is:
  - `exported.[build]` - reflector by which the export was created;
  - `exportedFiles. [build]` - reflector with a list of exported files;
- the sections `step`, `build`, `submodule` are copied unchanged;
- section `exported` is generated when the module is exported and contains information about the exported module. It also contains the link to the generated resources and a copy of the original `will-file`.

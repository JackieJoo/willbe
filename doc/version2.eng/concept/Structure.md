# `Will-file` structure

### Section <code>will-file</code>   

Higher structural element of <code>will-file</code> which consists of resources of single type or fields, which describe the module.  

There are 6 optional sections for building the module: `about`, `path`, `submodule`, `step`, `reflector`, `build` and one section generated by the `willbe` utility when exporting the module. It is section `exported`.  

The complete `will-file` structure with sections:  

```
will-file
    ├── about
    ├── submodule
    ├── path
    ├── reflector
    ├── step
    ├── exported
    └── build

```

The order and the number of sections in `will-file` is determined by its purpose. For example, the following structure is possible:   

```
will-file
    ├── step
    ├── about
    ├── build
    └── submodule

```

### Assigning of the `will-file` sections  

<details>
  <summary><a href="./concept/SectionAbout.md">Section <code>about</code></a></summary>
  The section has descriptive information about the module.
</details>
<details>
  <summary><a href="./concept/Paths.md#Section-path">Section <code>path</code></a></summary>
  The section has map of paths for fast understanding of files structure of the module.
</details>
<details>
  <summary><a href="./concept/SectionSubmodule.md">Section <code>submodule</code></a></summary>
  The section has information about submodules of the module.
</details>
<details>
  <summary><a href="./concept/Steps.md#Section-step">Section <code>step</code></a></summary>
  The section has steps which could be used by build for building of the module.
</details>
<details>
  <summary><a href="./concept/Reflectors.md#Section-reflector">Section <code>reflector</code></a></summary>
  The section has reflectors, special type of resource for operation on groups of files.
</details>
<details>
  <summary><a href="./concept/Builds.md#Section-build">Section <code>build</code></a></summary>
  Resources of the section describe sequence and conditions of building the module.
</details>
<details>
  <summary><a href="./concept/SectionExported.md">Section <code>exported</code></a></summary>
  Section of <code>out-will-file</code>, programatically generated with exporting of the module. It has list of exported files and it used by other modules for importing the module.

### Resources

Structural and functional element of <code>will-file</code>. Resources of the same type collected in a section.   

The section's resources are denoted declaratively. That is when indicated the result to be obtained and the sequence of actions to make the result is hidden.
The resources appearance of individual sections is different. In the figure the submodule `Tools` of the section` submodule` has a shortened record form and the `npm.install` resource of the section` step` has a full (extended) record form:

### Type of resource  

Functionality associated with group of resources restricted by its purpose. Examples of types of resources: path, submodule, step, build. Each type of resources has its own purpose and is treated by the utility differently.  

The `path` section has a `path` type of resources. The `path` resource points to the file (directory) path and it is used in routing for other resources. The `step` section has the resources of the "function of [module](Module.mdModule) construction" type (short name is "step") - the resource specifies the procedure for construction and the conditions for its implementation. Section `reflector` has a "reflector" type resource. Reflector specifies execution of operations with files. The `submodule` section connects the "submodule" type resources. The submodule is the auxiliary parts of the module, it's the individual modules. The` build `section places the resources of the "build assembly" type (short name is "build"). Build specifies module construction scenario and the sequence of its execution. The` exported` section includes descriptive fields and links to the resources of other sections. Section `about` does not have resources but it contains descriptive information about the module.

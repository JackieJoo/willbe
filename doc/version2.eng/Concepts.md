## Quick start

For quick start [install](<./tutorial/Instalation.md>) utility `willbe`, [get acquainted with](<./tutorial/CLI.md>) command line interface and create the first [module "Hello World"](<./tutorial/HelloWorld.md>). [Read](<./tutorial/Abstract.md>) abstract if you are wondering what is it for and what philosophy is behind utility `willbe`.

For gentle introduction use tutorials. For getting exhaustive information on one or another aspect use list of concepts to find a concept of interest and get familiar with it.

## Concepts

<details><summary><a href="./concept/WillFile.md">
      Configuration <code>will-file</code>
  </a></summary>
  Configuration for describing and building a module. Each formal module has such a file.

<details><summary><a href="./concept/WillFileNamedAndSplit.md#Named-will-file">
      Named <code>will-file</code>
  </a></summary>
  Kind of <code>will-file</code> which has a nonstandard name. It makes possible to have multiple modules with different names in a directory.
</details>
<details><summary><a href="./concept/WillFileNamedAndSplit.md#Split-will-file">
      Split <code>will-file</code>
  </a></summary>
  Splitting <code>will-file</code> into two files. One of them is for importing data and other is for exporting. It makes possible to split data related building and to develop a module and data which can be used by another modules.
</details>
